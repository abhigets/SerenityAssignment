# Assignment 1
(Using BDD approach, build a small automation framework)

### Scenarios implemented
1. Search for a valid post code (should_be_able_to_search_a_postcode_and_see_weather_details)
2. Valid all the manditory field (should_be_able_to_search_a_postcode_and_see_weather_details)
3. Valid all the optional field (should_be_able_to_search_a_postcode_and_see_weather_details)
4. Search Non existing post code (should_be_able_to_see_error_message_for_invalid_postcode)
5. Search invalid post code (should_be_able_to_see_error_message_for_non_existing_postcode)

### Framework used
This project is test automation of Weather Cherker app ("https://serene-mountain-14043.herokuapp.com") using serenity automation framework with Screen Play Design Pattern


### Running test
Clone the repo 
Make sure you have maven
```sh
$ geckodriver &
$ mvn clean verify
```

### Running in headless mode
This will enable us to run automation in CI tools like Jenkins , GO .

Install Phantomjs
```sh
$ brew install phantomjs
```

Run following command
```sh
$ mvn clean -Dwebdriver.driver=phantomjs verify
```

### Reports
After running the test serenity reports will be generated at following location
```sh
<ProjectDir>/target/site/serenity/index.html
```
# Assignment 2
Q : Suppose you want to run some of these test in a development pipeline thats independent from the backend pipeline. Explain how you could approach this:

  1. What techniques,framework or tools you might thing using
  2. How you would go abount integrating this framework with a CI pipeline.

1. To run few of the test in development pipeline one can use following approach
  a. cucumber supports tags e.g. â€œ@SmokeTests" can be associated with a scenario in feature file
  b. Junit tags e.g. @WithTag("SmokeTests") can be associate to junit test.
2. As I have already used maven we can trigger above annoted test cases from command line arguments of junit or cucumber tags can be used
 a. Cucumber :  -Dcucumber.options="--tags @SmokeTests"
 b. Junit : -Dtags="color:blue"
3. And then one can trigger above test with command line arguments with maven on CI [Jenkins add a downstream job/ pipleline step ]
 a. mvn clean verify -Dtags="color:blue"
